# Contact Keeper Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the frontend part of contact keeper app. I created this app using [Brad Traversy's](https://github.com/bradtraversy/) REACT FRONT TO BACK 2019 course . This is a contact keeper app created with **React**, **react hooks**, **context** and **JWT authentication**
